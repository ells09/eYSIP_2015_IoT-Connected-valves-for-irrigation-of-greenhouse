###Abstract

This project aims to build a compact and portable module that can be remotely accessed to turn ON/OFF the water supply in a trough, terrace garden or even an agricultural farm. The solution promises to be cheap and affordable to the common man and the setup is intended to be simple and without hassle. 

This project aims to touch the lack of automation on irrigation systems in agriculture and thus increase the throughput of the average farmer. Once installed this setup would allow you to remotely control the valve for one's irrigation system and also provides additional features such as timing based control and frequency in watering. This could really ease the user of his worry when he/she is not at around the house or the farm.

Latter part of this project also includes experimentation regarding moisture sensor integration. This would mean effective feedback to the user for watering. The ultimate goal of the project would be to eliminate the user from this loop and provide effective automation in irrigation through the Internet-of-things approach.
